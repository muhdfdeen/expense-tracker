## Features

- Add expenses with name and amount
- Expenses are displayed in a responsive table
- Total expenses are shown at the bottom of the table

## Usage

1. Enter a name and amount for the expense in the form.
2. Click **Add Expense**.
3. View your expenses listed in the table and the total amount updated automatically.

## Roadmap

Here are the features I plan to add to further enhance the Expense Tracker:

- Save expenses in the browser using `localStorage`.
- Add a delete button to each expense row.
- Allow users to edit existing expenses.
- Add options to sort expenses by name or amount.
